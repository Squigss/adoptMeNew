# adoptMeNew

Project current in progress. Created for University of Bristol's Web Technologies course. 

The project uses Node and Express for the backend and Vue for the frontend.

The website is an advertising platform for shelters to advertise pets for adoption. Upon completion of the project, the website will be slightly modified and donated to a shelter in Bristol.
